Advent of Code
==============

This repo contains Chris Northwood's attempts at the Advent of Code challenge.

Each challenge is represented in a folder, organised by year and day.

For some challenges, the script will output the answer to both parts. For
others, the commit history must be looked at to get the answer for part A,
or they are separated into part1 and part2.py.

`./docker.sh <year> <num>` can be used to benchmark, but only reliably for 2018 onwards.
